This improvement was essential to manage the different battery sources and to enhance overall product quality and traceability. Given the highly flammable nature of Li-ion batteries, strict regulation and compliance were imperative. This was one of my achievement in Dyson with minimal guidance."},{"id":"3","title":"Dyson Pioneer","description":"It was an event held by Dyson globally. I pitched an idea of the common 3R  concept which is  \"reduce, reuse and recycle\"  in the factory in the simplest act.\nAt times, wastage of materials are un-avoidable due research and development, but most time, one could actually think of this 3R concept to reduce the wastage. For an example, a magnet in a sub-assembly could be used a white board magnet.
